# KTP - AG Email Template

@KTP AG class -- html template for newsletter emails.
- I stole it from [here](!https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template)
and repurposed it with KTP colors

We'll get those points back hopefully. From what I heard though brothers get tired of templates so we may need some more creativity along the way.

This [link](!https://www.gmass.co/blog/use-custom-html-in-gmail-compose-window/) is a tutorial on how to add the HTML you just wrote into Gmail. I used option 2.

For hosting photos, I used GitHub pages to have an actual web link to photos (it's a lot of work).
I think you might be able to add photos into the Gmail once you copy and paste HTML.
I could edit the text at minimum.
